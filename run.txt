run rest-server.py and open the postman

take new tab and make it POST methode, give address with port number and route name

then in postman, body tab select json file, and write json file to pass tha data to application
we cannot pass the image as well as in json, it should be passed as base format

to pass as the image in json file, image should convert into encription format. a one of way to do it using base64.
using base 64 convert image into base64 format and pass as the image in json file

send the request, system will detect the number plate and crop it, as the output(base64) cropped plate will give.
u can decode and see the just numberplate.

also the system will generate the number of the plate as aString.

if u got internal server error 500, then just go line 52 of rest-server.py, it has passed 'key', change into 'image'.

but if u hve change it u will not get any response. bcz u have to use google api, in getNumberPlateValue.py
change ur google api number.
