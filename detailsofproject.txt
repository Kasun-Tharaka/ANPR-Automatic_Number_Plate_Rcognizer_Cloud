this project has implemented using tensorflow 1.x..., so do not use this, try to do it using such as yolo, detectron 
like those.

first creat a model to detect the car numberplates(can be yolo or detectron or any other model)
using opencv save it image directory

after detection, cropted image or bounding box(bbox coordinates) pass to the extraion of numbers from the image 
model(OCR) here it done with google api(google OCR - cloud ocr).

OCR => Optical Charactor Recognizer

this problem statement, OCR apply top of object detection

in this project, data annotation part, we hve done 2 step annotation and verification
* first annotate the whole plate
* annotate the each of charactors of the plate

then create a logic to compare predicted value from OCR with actual annotated values to comfirm.
